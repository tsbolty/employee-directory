This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

On start of this application, a call to "https://randomuser.me/api/?results=100" will be rendered to the page and display 100 employees with their thumbnail image, name, phone number, email and date of birth.

On state change of the search bar, React will re-render the page and show you only the employee names that include the value typed into the search bar. You may also click on the "Name" table header and all employees on the page will be sorted alphebetically.
